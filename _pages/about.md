I am a Fellow at the <a href="https://crifoundation.org/" style="text-decoration: none">CRI Foundation</a> working with <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/div/" style="text-decoration: none">USAID's Development Innovation Ventures</a> and a Postdoctoral Scholar (until August 2024) with the <a href="https://dil.uchicago.edu/" style="text-decoration: none">Development Innovation Lab at the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute for Economics</a>.

I am dedicated to supporting policy, backed by scientific rigor, that aims to address poverty and inequality. My research focuses on how policies can be designed to improve motivation and welfare in public and private sector settings.
