<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Monitoring policies designed to maximize deterrence must account for attempts by agents to evade detection. This paper examines the strategic responses of bureaucrats, who implement India's employment guarantee program, as their expectations of being audited change. Exploiting random assignment to audit timing over multiple waves (without replacement), I find the rate of deterrence for misappropriated expenditures is increasing in bureaucrats' expectations of being audited. In addition, bureaucrats evade detection by adjusting the timing and type of expenditure to misappropriate. Applying a model of Bayesian persuasion, I analyze how information communicated on the likelihood of being audited should be designed. I estimate a sufficient statistic from the model to solve for the optimal signal and analyze welfare under counterfactuals. Concentrated incentives, i.e. notifying of audit timing in advance, would have persuaded bureaucrats to misappropriate USD 35m less in expenditures (16% of average annual expenditures) when compared to dispersed incentives, i.e. messages are uninformative and audit timing is unpredictable.
